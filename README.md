# drf-base
Django REST framework base. A simple project that I, or anyone else, can fork for a stable, working, browsable, tested, Django-based REST API.

AKA, the shit.

### development
To fire up the development server, execute the following:
```bash
./manage.py runserver
```
This should bring up the API on `localhost:8000`.
